        <div class="subheading mb-5">Research AssistantðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Nikhil Devaraj, and I am a first-year Psychology Major at the University of California, Riverside. Currently, I am working towards my bachelors of science degree in psychology in order to get into a Phd program and begin working as a research professor at a prestigious college or university. I have had ample research experience, as I have conducted a complete research paper under Dr. Craig Ross at Boston University. With his guidance, I conducted a scientific psychological experiment about the effectiveness of alcohol advertising and counter advertising. I learned much about the research process, as well as potential hurdles that I may run into when I begin researching as a fully independent researcher. In the future, I hope to find more opportunities do conduct psychological experiments and contribute to the scientific literature.
I am also an active member of UCR Afsana, UC Riversideâ€™s premier intercollegiate Bollywood Fusion Dance team. I preform Bollywood Dance, Bhangra, Hip-Hop, Contemporary, and Jazz as a member of UCR Afsana. As a dancer, I have travelled across the country to perform at various competitions. Being a member of Afsana has taught me valuable lessons about cooperation within a team, sportsmanship, and has even kept me in shape physically and mentally.
In high school, I was a very active member in a variety of clubs and programs. I volunteered frequently with Rebuilding Together, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to rebuild the neglected homes of United States homeowners who are physically and financially unable to maintain their homes. Serving these underrepresented people helped me find my place in society, and helped me open my eyes about the often times overlooked struggles that everyday Americans face.
I was the co-founder of UDC, the urban dance club at our school. This club held a variety of urban dance workshops, where we taught our classmates unique styles of dance and motivated them to get out of their boundaries. As a dancer, I feel very passionate about getting new people to enjoy dance and appreciate dance as a great way to improve mental and physical health. This was certainly accomplished when I helped create this club. I was also a member of the varsity track team at my school, where I took on the responsibility of training younger runners while upholding the athletic standards for the rest of the team. 
I worked at Round Table Pizza for around 10 months, where I was given a variety of tasks including making pizza, being a cashier, cleaning, serving tables, and delivering pizza. This experience helped mold me into a stronger individual, as it taught me timeliness, work ethic, cooperation, as well as social skills and leadership.
Finally, I had an internship at Dr. Vidya Valadaâ€™s medical clinic, in New York City. I worked as a nurse assistant, as I handled Dr. Valadaâ€™s schedules and patients over the phone. This experience gave me lots of insight into the professional line of work, and it helped me better prepare for the professional line of work in the future. <br><br>
